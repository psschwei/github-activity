# github-activity

This utility retrieves the GitHub activity for a specified user and prints it to the console.

## Usage

Download the binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/psschwei/github-activity/releases) and add it to your `PATH`.

To see a list of options, run `gha --help`:

```bash
$ gha --help

Usage:
  gha [flags]

Flags:
  -d, --domain string   Github domain (default "github.com")
  -e, --end string      Collect activities up to this date (default "2025-03-11")

The utility will then retrieve the GitHub activity for the specified user and print it to the console.

By default, it will pull activity for the previous seven days. To choose a different date range, pass a start date and (optional) end date to the script.

```bash
gha -s 2025-01-01 -e 2025-02-28
